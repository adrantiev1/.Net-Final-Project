## Overview
- **Sales** - Anton Drantiev
    - Add common user controls to the web application, such as a control to handle error messages and perform try/catch operations (like the MessageUserControl). Also add information on the About.aspx page to list the following (under appropriate headings):
        - Team member names and (if possible) photos
        - Information about the default security roles (if any) and the default users and their passwords. Include any other relevant information about the security configurations for your site.
        - Information about the connection string values used on your site.
  
- **Receiving** - Alexey Dvorkin
    - Creating the Solution with the class library project and web application. NuGet packages must be updated for the solution.
    - Provide documentation about your project on the home page (Default.aspx) for the site. Include a logo for your team and show it on the home page as part of the page title. The documentation for your project must include the following:
        - List of your team members and the areas of the site that they were responsible for developing. Also, identify which parts of the shared components each member was responsible for.
        - List of known bugs in your project, including portions of your lab that are incomplete. List these bugs under a heading that specifies the release version of your application (such as v 1.0.0 - Beta).
        
- **Jobing** - Bo Pang
    - Generate the entity classes and DbContext class that maps to the project's database. Update the generated entity validations to have appropriate user friendly messages.

- **Purchasing** - Emily Urdaneta
    - Add navigation for your web application in the Site.master page. Also modify the Site.master to replace the default application name with the identifier of your team and the name of the project (e.g.: eBike - Team A). Lastly, set up the connection string values for your website's DAL. Add a separate folder for each subsystem in the website. Place at least one page in each folder with the subsystem name as its title banner. This should allow you to test your menu.
